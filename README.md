Telnet Server for M5StickCPlus

This is a simple Telnet server example for the M5StickCPlus microcontroller using the Arduino platform and the M5StickCPlus library. It allows you to establish a Telnet connection with the M5StickCPlus and send/receive text messages.

Prerequisites

Before using this code, make sure you have the following components and software installed:

M5StickCPlus microcontroller
Arduino IDE
M5StickCPlus library (install it via Arduino Library Manager)
WiFi library (already included in Arduino IDE)
An understanding of how to upload code to the M5StickCPlus

Getting Started

Connect your M5StickCPlus to your computer using a USB cable.

Open the Arduino IDE and make sure you have selected the correct board (M5Stick-C Plus) and port.

Copy and paste the code from this readme.md file into your Arduino IDE.

Set your desired SoftAP (Access Point) settings by modifying the following variables in the code:

apSSID: The name of your SoftAP (SSID).
apPassword: The password for your SoftAP.
apChannel: The Wi-Fi channel to use for the SoftAP.
apMaxConnections: The maximum number of clients that can connect to the SoftAP.
Upload the code to your M5StickCPlus.

After uploading, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE. You should see debugging information as the M5StickCPlus starts the SoftAP and Telnet server.

Connect your computer or other devices to the SoftAP network with the SSID you provided in apSSID.

Use a Telnet client (e.g., PuTTY, Windows Telnet, or any terminal emulator with Telnet support) to connect to the Telnet server at the IP address displayed on the M5StickCPlus's LCD.

You can now type and send messages via Telnet to the M5StickCPlus, and it will echo the messages back to you. The code is set up to handle incoming Telnet connections and messages from multiple clients.

Customization

You can extend this code to perform more advanced actions when receiving messages from clients or modify the behavior to suit your specific project requirements. The code currently echoes received characters and broadcasts them to all connected clients.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, make sure you have the correct libraries and board selected in the Arduino IDE.
Check your M5StickCPlus's connections and ensure it's powered on.
Ensure you are connecting to the correct SoftAP network.
Verify that your Telnet client is correctly configured to connect to port 23.
